# Xcode UI Languages

This repository keeps track of all the languages that can be selected in **Xcode** for a project’s localizations. Since Apple doesn’t provide a public, up-to-date list of these languages, this repo serves as a reference for developers who want to know which languages are available in Xcode’s UI.

## Purpose

When you navigate in Xcode to:

```

Xcode > Project Navigator > Localizations

````

you can select from a list of supported languages for your project. This list is not documented anywhere publicly. This repository maintains that list in a structured format so it can be easily referenced or processed.

## How It Works

1. The file `xcode-ui-languages-list.txt` contains all the language identifiers supported by Xcode.
2. The script `generate.swift` reads this list and outputs a formatted version:
   - By default, it outputs **JSON** (`all-languages-formatted.txt`) containing each language’s **display name** and **identifier**.
   - You can also output **plain text** for easy reading using the `-t` flag:

```bash
swift generate.swift -t
````

Whenever a new Xcode version is released, we have to manually add any new languages to `xcode-ui-languages-list.txt` and run the script again to update the formatted output.

## Files

- **`xcode-ui-languages-list.txt`** – List of Xcode language identifiers (one per line).
- **`generate.swift`** – Swift script that reads the language list and generates a formatted output.
- **`all-languages-formatted.txt`** – Output generated by `generate.swift` (JSON or text).

## Usage

Generate JSON output:

```bash
swift generate.swift
```

Generate plain text output:

```bash
swift generate.swift -t
```

## Contribution

This repository is intended as a reference for developers looking to handle Xcode project localizations programmatically or for documentation purposes.
